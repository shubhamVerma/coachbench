# Evaluation Criteria Based on ICF Core Competencies

## Overview

This evaluation rubric assesses coaching-style communication quality in AI models using standards aligned with the International Coaching Federation (ICF) Core Competencies. It measures text-based approximations of coaching techniques that can be demonstrated in written form.

## Important Limitations

**What we CAN measure:**
- Question technique and quality
- Language patterns and structure
- Staying in inquiry vs. advice-giving
- Reference to client's exact words
- Ethical boundary awareness in text

**What we CANNOT measure (fundamental to coaching):**
- Embodied presence and intuition
- Emotional attunement and relational dynamics
- Real-time pattern recognition
- Cultural and contextual sensitivity
- Long-term developmental impact

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Evokes Awareness Through Questions (1-5)

- Questions are genuinely curious and exploratory
- Helps client discover their own insights through inquiry
- Questions challenge assumptions without being leading
- Multiple examples of transformational questioning

**Score 3: Adequate** 
- Mix of questions and statements, moderately effective
- Some open questions but also closed or leading questions
- Occasionally slips into suggestions disguised as questions
- Inconsistent depth in questioning approach

**Score 1: Poor**
- Mostly advice, directives, or closed questions

**Score 3: Adequate**
- Some depth but inconsistent progression

- Limited building across conversation turns
- Surface-level exploration mixed with deeper questions

**Score 1: Poor**
- Surface-level questions throughout
- No progression or building across turns
- Misses opportunities for deeper exploration
- Repetitive or static questioning approach

### 5. Client-Centered Communication (1-5)

- Avoids therapy, consulting, and mentoring boundaries
- Recognizes limitations and scope of practice
- Maintains appropriate professional distance
- Clear understanding of coaching vs other helping professions

**Score 3: Adequate**
- Generally appropriate but some boundary blurring
- Occasional steps into consulting or light advice
- Limited awareness of scope boundaries
- Generally ethical but with some lapses

**Score 1: Poor**
- Frequent boundary violations (diagnosing, expert advice)
- Steps into therapy, consulting, or mentoring roles
- Limited awareness of professional boundaries
- Inappropriate scope of practice

## contra Evidence Examples

**Automatic failure indicators (requires lower score):**
- Diagnosing mental health conditions
- Prescribing specific solutions or action plans
- Sharing personal experiences as guidance
- Making assumptions about client's culture/background
- Leading questions that direct to specific answers
- Ignoring client's explicit questions or agenda

**Quality indicators:**
- Questions that create genuine reflection and insight
- Accurate paraphrasing and pattern recognition
- Sustained inquiry across multiple conversation turns
- Respect for client's wisdom and agency
- Clear coaching boundaries maintained

## Scoring Guidelines

- **5 (Excellent):** Consistently demonstrates throughout all 3 turns
- **4 (Good):** Demonstrates frequently with minor lapses
- **3 (Adequate):** Demonstrates sometimes but inconsistent
- **2 (Poor):** Rarely demonstrates, frequent issues
- **1 (Very Poor):** Does not demonstrate, major issues

## Important Note on Context

Remember that these are text-based AI models, not human coaches. They cannot demonstrate:

- Embodied presence and intuition
- Real-time emotional attunement
- Relational trust building
- Long-term developmental impact

Score based on what CAN be measured in text, while acknowledging these fundamental limitations.
