    "content": "That sounds really frustrating\u2014and honestly, very human. You\u2019re not lazy or broken; you\u2019re stuck in a loop that a *lot* of people fall into, especially when a project feels heavy or unclear.\n\nA few things to keep in mind first (because this matters):\n\n- **Scrolling isn\u2019t a moral failure**. It\u2019s often your brain seeking relief from discomfort, not avoiding work because you don\u2019t care.\n- The fact that you *want* to work but can\u2019t start usually means there\u2019s something about the project that feels overwhelming, unclear, or emotionally loaded.\n\nLet\u2019s gently break this down.\n\n### Why this cycle happens\nOften it\u2019s a combo of:\n- **Too big / vague a task** \u2192 your brain doesn\u2019t know where to start\n- **Perfection pressure** \u2192 \u201cIf I start, it has to be good\u201d\n- **Low energy or stress** \u2192 scrolling gives quick relief\n- **Habit + easy access** \u2192 your phone wins by default\n\nNone of these mean you lack discipline.\n\n### A few ways to interrupt the cycle (without forcing yourself)\n\n**1. Shrink the starting point to almost nothing**\nInstead of \u201cwork on my project,\u201d try:\n- \u201cOpen the document\u201d\n- \u201cWrite one bad sentence\u201d\n- \u201cLook at the requirements for 2 minutes\u201d\n\nTell yourself you\u2019re *allowed to stop* after that. Starting is the win.\n\n**2. Make scrolling slightly harder**\nNot eliminate it\u2014just add friction:\n- Put your phone in another room\n- Log out of apps\n- Use a website blocker for 25 minutes  \nYou\u2019re not banning scrolling, just delaying it.\n\n**3. Use time, not motivation**\nSet a timer for **10\u201325 minutes** and decide:\n> \u201cI\u2019ll work until the timer ends, no matter how bad it is.\u201d\n\nWhen the timer ends, you *stop*. This makes the task feel finite and safer.\n\n**4. Lower the bar on quality**\nTell yourself:\n> \u201cThis is a draft no one will ever see.\u201d\n\nBad work is the doorway to good work. You can\u2019t edit nothing.\n\n**5. Be kind to the stuck part**\nInstead of \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just do this?\u201d, try:\n> \u201cSomething about this is hard right now. What is it?\u201d\n\nSometimes naming the fear (\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing it right\u201d) loosens its grip.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019re open to it, I\u2019d love to help more concretely:\n- What kind of project is it?\n- Is there a deadline?\n- What\u2019s the *very first* thing you think you\u2019re supposed to do when you sit down?\n\nWe can turn this into a starting plan that actually feels doable.",

    "content": "That makes a lot of sense. Research papers are *perfectly designed* to trigger overwhelm: vague expectations, lots of choices, and the feeling that you\u2019re supposed to \u201cknow\u201d what you\u2019re doing already. The good news is that intro psych papers usually follow a very predictable structure\u2014you don\u2019t have to invent anything from scratch.\n\nLet\u2019s make this feel concrete and safe to start.\n\n---\n\n## First: you are **not** behind\nTwo weeks is actually a *comfortable* amount of time for this kind of paper **if** you start gently instead of trying to do it all at once.\n\nRight now, the goal is **not** to write a good outline.\nThe goal is to create a *bad, messy, totally provisional* one.\n\n---\n\n## A low-pressure way to start (15\u201320 minutes)\n\n### Step 1: Open a document and title it\nLiterally just:\n> \u201cPsychology Research Paper \u2013 Working Draft\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. No outline yet.\n\n### Step 2: Answer these 3 questions in bullet points (no sentences required)\nDon\u2019t worry about correctness\u2014this is just thinking on the page.\n\n1. **What topic are you leaning toward?**  \n   (e.g., sleep and memory, social media and anxiety, classical conditioning, etc.)\n\n2. **What\u2019s one thing you already know or believe about this topic?**  \n   Even if it\u2019s vague or \u201cprobably wrong.\u201d\n\n3. **What\u2019s one thing you\u2019re curious about or confused by?**  \n   This often becomes your research question.\n\nIf you do only this today, you\u2019ve made real progress.\n\n---\n\n## Then: the simplest possible outline (psych-friendly)\n\nMost intro psych research papers roughly look like this:\n\n1. **Introduction**\n   - What is the topic?\n   - Why does it matter?\n   - What question is the paper answering?\n\n2. **Background / Literature Review**\n   - What do researchers already know about this?\n   - Key theories or findings (2\u20134 main ideas)\n\n3. **Discussion / Implications**\n   - What do these findings mean?\n   - How do they connect to real life or other psych concepts?\n\n4. **Conclusion**\n   - Quick summary\n   - Why this topic is important\n\nYour outline can literally be:\n\n```\nI. Introduction\n   - Topic:\n   - Why it matters:\n   - Research question:\n\nII. Background\n   - Study 1:\n   - Study 2:\n   - Theory:\n\nIII. Discussion\n   - What this shows:\n   - Real-world relevance:\n\nIV. Conclusion\n```\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fill it all in\u2014just *seeing* the structure helps your brain relax.\n\n---\n\n## How to stop the scroll-escape in the moment\n\nWhen you feel the urge to scroll, try this script:\n> \u201cI don\u2019t need to finish this. I just need to work until the timer ends.\u201d\n\nSet a **10-minute timer**.\nPhone in another room.\nWhen the timer ends, you are free to scroll\u2014no guilt.\n\nIronically, knowing you *can* stop makes it easier to keep going.\n\n---\n\n## One important mindset shift\nYou\u2019re not overwhelmed because you\u2019re bad at this.\nYou\u2019re overwhelmed because **you\u2019re trying to start at the level of a finished paper**.\n\nOutlines are *thinking tools*, not commitments. You are allowed to be \u201con the wrong track\u201d at first\u2014that\u2019s how you find the right one.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, we can:\n- Pick a topic together\n- Turn your confusion into a clear research question\n- Build a one-page outline you can actually use\n- Break the next two weeks into stress-free chunks\n\nTell me:\n1. Do you already have a topic in mind, or are you still choosing?\n2. Does your professor have any specific requirements (number of sources, APA, etc.)?\n\nWe\u2019ll take this one calm step at a time.",

Let\u2019s aim for the second.\n\nFirst, a quick reassurance:\n> Feeling overwhelmed **does not mean you\u2019re doing this wrong**.  \nIt means you\u2019re at the *thinking* stage, which just feels uncomfortable.\n\nWe\u2019ll narrow this down in a way that removes pressure, not adds to it.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Narrow the topic without committing (5\u201310 minutes)\n\nInstead of choosing *the* angle, we\u2019ll try on a few **temporary lenses**.

Introduction\n   - Why social media is important/relevant\n   - Brief mention of anxiety\n   - Research question\n\nII.
