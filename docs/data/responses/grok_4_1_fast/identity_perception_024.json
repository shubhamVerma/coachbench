It's completely normal to feel envious when you're bombarded with everyone else's highlight reels. But here's the truth: those posts are the tip of the iceberg. Behind the new cars and vacations, there's often debt, burnout, or stress they're not sharing.\n\n### Quick Ways to Shake It Off:\n- **Curate your feed**: Unfollow or mute accounts that trigger you. Replace with inspiring, low-key content (e.g., personal growth podcasts or hobby pages).\n- **Track *your* wins**: Keep a \"progress jar\" or journal. Write down small victories weekly\u2014what skills you've built, money saved, or routines you've stuck to. Your old routine? It's probably more stable than it feels.\n- **Set micro-goals**: Instead of \"match their life,\" aim for one upgrade: side hustle for 30 min/day, budget for a fun trip fund, or skill-building course. Momentum builds from there.\n- **Gratitude reset**: Daily, list 3 things you're thankful for in *your* life. It rewires your brain from scarcity to abundance.\n- **Talk it out**: Chat with a friend (ironically, the real kind) or therapist. You're not inadequate\u2014you're human.\n\nYou're not falling behind; you're on *your* path. Progress compounds quietly. Give yourself credit for showing up, and watch how that envy fades as you focus inward. You've got this\u2014what's one small step you'll take today?",
